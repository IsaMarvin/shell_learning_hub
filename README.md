### Unix 🕰️

Unix is an operating system that was developed in the 1970s. It was designed to be powerful, reliable, and secure. Unix introduced many important concepts and features that are still used in modern operating systems today. It became popular in universities, businesses, and government institutions. Unix uses a hierarchical file system and provides a command-line interface for interacting with the system. It has a rich history and has influenced the development of numerous operating systems.

### Linux 🐧

Linux is an operating system that is based on the Unix design principles. It was created in the 1990s by Linus Torvalds, and it quickly gained popularity. Linux is often referred to as a "Unix-like" operating system because it shares many similarities with Unix in terms of its design philosophy and command-line interface. One key difference is that Linux is open-source, which means its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This openness has led to a large community of developers and contributors who collaborate to improve and expand Linux. Linux is known for its stability, security, and versatility. It is used in a wide range of devices, from servers and mainframes to smartphones and embedded systems. Popular Linux distributions (or versions) include Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, and many others. Each distribution offers its own set of features and software packages.

In summary, Unix and Linux are operating systems that provide the foundation for running programs on computers. Unix is an older operating system with a rich history, while Linux is a newer, open-source operating system that is based on Unix principles. Linux has gained popularity for its stability, security, and flexibility, and it has a large and active community of developers.

# File System Organization 🗂️

File system organization refers to the way files and directories (folders) are structured and arranged within a computer's storage system. It determines how files are stored, accessed, and managed.

<details>
  <summary>ℹ️ Click for a detailed explanation</summary>
<br/>
File system organization provides a way to organize and manage files, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. To understand file system organization, let's compare it to organizing physical items, such as books in a library or documents in a filing cabinet.

In a Unix-based file system, such as Linux, the file system organization can be compared to organizing books in a hierarchical structure. The root of the file system represents the top-level directory ("/"), which is similar to the library itself. Different sections and shelves within the library correspond to directories and subdirectories. Each book represents a file. For example, the directory "/usr/bin" represents the "bin" directory within the "usr" directory.

In a Windows file system, the organization can be likened to organizing books within multiple filing cabinets. Each filing cabinet represents a drive (e.g., C:, D:, etc.), and each cabinet drawer corresponds to a directory. The organization within the drawer is similar to that in the Unix-based example.

Regardless of the specific file system, the organization helps users locate and manage files efficiently, just as library systems aid in finding specific books in real life.

# What is the Shell? 💻🐚

The shell is a program that provides a way to interact with the Linux operating system. It acts as a command-line interface where users can give instructions to the computer by typing commands. The shell allows users to navigate the file system, run programs, manipulate files, and perform various tasks on a Linux system.

<details>
  <summary>ℹ️ Click for a detailed explanation</summary>
<br/>

Think of the shell as a translator between you and the computer. You tell the shell what you want to do, and it communicates with the operating system to get the job done. You can use the shell to navigate the file system, run programs, manipulate files, and perform various tasks on a Linux system.

📚 The shell makes it possible to control the computer using text commands rather than relying on graphical interfaces with buttons and menus. It's a powerful tool for advanced users and programmers to work efficiently and automate tasks. The shell allows you to execute commands, access system utilities, and write scripts to automate complex operations.

Understanding how to use the shell is fundamental to working with Unix-based systems like Linux. It provides a flexible and powerful interface to interact with the operating system and perform a wide range of tasks.

# How to Navigate in a Unix System 🧭

Imagine a Unix system as a big city with numerous streets and buildings. To move around in the Unix system, you need to know your current location and where you want to go.

Navigating in a Unix system involves understanding the file system structure and using commands like "pwd" to check the current directory, "cd" to change directories, and "ls" to list the contents of a directory. Absolute and relative pathnames are used to specify the location of files and directories.


## **pwd** 📂
pwd stands for "print working directory",
It's like asking the computer, "Where am I right now?"
When you type pwd and press Enter,and It will shows the current directory(the folder) you are in.

## **cd** 🚶‍♂️

The `cd` command stands for "change directory."

The `cd` command allows you to change your current working directory as if you are entering a different room or opening a different folder to explore its contents.

<details>
  <summary>ℹ️ Click for a detailed explanation</summary>
<br/>

Imagine you are exploring a maze filled with different rooms. Each room represents a directory or folder on your computer. To navigate through the maze and move to a different room, you use the `cd` command.

The `cd` command allows you to change your current working directory, which is like your current position in the maze. You can use the `cd` command followed by the name or path of the directory you want to go to.

There are two types of pathnames you can use: absolute pathnames and relative pathnames.

- Absolute Pathnames: An absolute pathname starts from the root directory, represented by a forward slash ("/"), and follows the branches of the directory tree until you reach the desired directory. It provides the complete path from the root to the destination directory. For example, if you want to go to a directory called "bin" located within the "usr" directory, you would use the absolute pathname "/usr/bin".

- Relative Pathnames: A relative pathname starts from your current working directory and navigates through the directory structure. It uses special notations to represent positions within the file system tree. The dot (.) notation refers to the current working directory itself, and the dot dot (..) notation refers to the parent directory of the current working directory. For instance, if you are in the "/usr/bin" directory and want to go to its parent directory, which is "/usr", you can use the relative pathname "..".

You can also combine the dot notation with the slash (/) to specify a subdirectory within the current working directory. For example, if you are in the "/usr" directory and want to go to the "bin" directory within it, you can use the relative pathname "./bin".

Additionally, there are a few shortcuts you can use with the `cd` command:

- Typing `cd` alone takes you to your home directory, which is like your base starting point in the maze.
- Typing `cd ~user_name` changes the working directory to the home directory of the specified user.
- Typing `cd -` changes the working directory to the previous one you were in.

Remember, the `cd` command helps you move between directories in the file system, just like navigating through rooms in a maze. By understanding absolute and relative pathnames, as well as using shortcuts, you can easily change directories and explore different parts of your computer's file system.
</details>

## **ls** 📋

The `ls` command stands for "list."

It's like looking inside a folder to see what's in it.

<details>
  <summary>ℹ️ Click for a detailed explanation</summary>
<br/>

When you run `ls` without any options, it lists the files and directories in your current working directory.

You can also specify a directory by adding its path after `ls` to list its contents instead. For example, `ls /bin` lists the files in the "/bin" directory.

Adding the "-l" option to `ls` (like `ls -l`) displays the files in a long format, providing more information about each file.

The long format includes details such as file permissions, owner, group, file size, and modification time.

File permissions are represented by a series of characters. The first character indicates the file type: "-" for a regular file and "d" for a directory.

The following three characters represent the read, write, and execute permissions for the file's owner, the next three for the group, and the final three for others.

The file name is displayed at the end of each line in the long format.

By using `ls` and its options, you can conveniently view and explore the files and directories in a directory, obtaining information about them such as permissions and sizes.

</details>

## **less** 📖🔍

The `less` command allows you to view the contents of a file one page at a time.

When you type `less` followed by the name of a file and press Enter, it shows you the contents of the file that you can scroll through.

It's like reading a book or a document on your computer.

<details>
  <summary>ℹ️ Click for a detailed explanation</summary>
<br/>

Text files contain human-readable information and are represented using characters and numbers.

The `less` program is used to view these text files in a compact and organized manner.

To use `less`, simply type `less` followed by the name of the text file you want to view. For example, `less my_file.txt` will display the contents of the file "my_file.txt".

Once you're viewing the file with `less`, you can navigate through it using the following commands:

- **Page Up**: Press the `Page Up` key or the `b` key to scroll up one page.

- **Page Down**: Press the `Page Down` key or the `Space` key to scroll down one page.

- **Scroll Up**: Press the `Up` arrow key to scroll up one line at a time.

- **Scroll Down**: Press the `Down` arrow key to scroll down one line at a time.

- **Search**: Press the `/` key followed by a search term to search for a specific word or phrase in the file. Press `n` to find the next occurrence of the search term.

- **Quit**: Press the `q` key to exit `less` and return to the command prompt.

That's it! With `less` and its navigation commands, you can easily view and read the contents of text files.

</details>

## **touch** ✏️📄

The `touch` command is used to create a new, empty file.

When you type `touch` followed by the name of a file and press Enter, it creates a file with that name.

For example, if you want to create a file called "newFile.txt," you can type `touch newFile.txt` and press Enter.

It's like creating a blank piece of paper to write or draw on.

 - Note: If you use "touch" with a file that already exists, it will only modify the timestamp of that file. It does not change the content or overwrite the file.

## **file** 📁🔍

The `file` command is used to determine the type of a file. It provides information about the file's format, content, and characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>ℹ️ Click for a detailed explanation</summary>
<br/>

The `file` command is a helpful tool in Linux that tells you what type of file you're dealing with. It provides information about the format, content, and characteristics of a file without needing to open it. This can be particularly useful when you come across files that you're not familiar with.

To use the `file` command, simply type `file` followed by the name of the file you want to check. For example, if you have a file called "my_file.txt," you would type `file my_file.txt`. The `file` command recognizes different types of files and provides descriptions for each type.

Here are some examples of file types and their descriptions:

- **ASCII text**: This means the file contains plain text that can be easily read and understood.

- **Bourne-Again shell script text**: It indicates that the file is a script written in the Bash programming language.

- **ELF 64-bit LSB executable**: This refers to an executable file, which means it's a program that your computer can run.

- **ELF 64-bit LSB shared object**: It denotes a shared library file used by executable programs.

- **GNU tar archive**: This type of file is an archive that stores a group of files together. You'll often encounter it when working with compressed files or backups.

- **gzip compressed data**: It indicates that the file is compressed using the gzip utility.

- **HTML document text**: It means the file contains a web page written in HTML, which is used to create websites.

- **JPEG image data**: This tells you that the file is an image in the JPEG format.

- **PostScript document text**: It refers to a file containing commands in the PostScript language, often used for printing or graphical tasks.

- **Zip archive data**: This denotes a compressed archive file created with the zip utility.

By using the `file` command, you can quickly find out what kind of file you have and get a better understanding of its contents. It's especially helpful when you come across files that you're not familiar with, allowing you to determine how to work with them or which programs to use.

## **Wildcards** 🃏🔍

Wildcards are special characters in the shell that allow you to select groups of filenames based on patterns. They enhance the power and efficiency of commands by enabling you to work with multiple files at once.

<details>
  <summary>ℹ️ Click for a detailed explanation</summary>
<br/>

Here are some commonly used wildcards:

1. **Asterisk (*) Wildcard:** It matches any characters (including none or multiple characters). For example, "*" selects all filenames in a directory.

2. **Question Mark (?) Wildcard:** It matches any single character. For example, "?" selects filenames with just one character.

3. **Bracket ([]) Wildcard:** It matches any character that is listed inside the brackets. For example, "[abc]" selects filenames starting with "a", "b", or "c".

4. **POSIX Character Classes:** These are special notations to represent sets of characters within brackets. For example, `[:digit:]` matches any numeral (0-9), and `[:lower:]` matches lowercase letters.

5. **Exclamation Mark (!) in Brackets:** It matches any character that is not listed inside the brackets. For example, "[![:lower:]]" selects filenames that don't end with a lowercase letter.

By using these wildcards, you can create simple patterns to select specific filenames or groups of filenames that match your criteria. Wildcards can be used with any command that works with filenames, making it easy to perform actions on multiple files at once.

For example, if you want to delete all files starting with "report" and ending with ".txt", you can use the wildcard pattern "report*.txt" to select them all.

Wildcards are a beginner-friendly way to work with files in the shell, helping you quickly manipulate or find specific files without manually typing each filename. They are a handy tool to have in your command-line arsenal!
